This files are for LINQPad but contains plain c#, with exception of the `.Dump()` extension methods this code can compiles in a single file.

# Fun Solutions
Most solutions are not going for efficiency but try to limit the implementation to (a single serries of) Linq statements only and avoid complex conditional code blocks. But sometimes the solutions just becomes funny or even elegant.

* [2023/day 13](2022/day 13.linq) > A very binary check for single bit difference.
* [2022/day 2](2022/day 2.linq) > Rock-Paper-Scissors using well chosen enums and calculations only. No if other conditional statements or dictionaries used.
